# Heuristic Tetris Agent Results Summary

## Evolution of Our Approach

Our Tetris agent went through several iterations before arriving at the current implementation:

1. **Simple Hole Avoidance**: We started with a basic approach that focused solely on avoiding holes (empty cells with filled cells above them).

2. **Height Penalty**: We added a penalty for board height to prevent the agent from building tall, unstable structures.

3. **Additional Heuristics**: We expanded our heuristic set to include bumpiness (penalizing uneven surfaces), lines cleared (rewarding line clears), and well depth (rewarding the creation of wells for I-pieces).

4. **End State Simulation**: Finally, we implemented a simulation-based approach that explores all possible action sequences and evaluates the final board states.

The final implementation had a critical issue: the agent was only executing `HARD_DROP` actions because it wasn't properly exploring different piece positions. This was fixed by modifying the hash function to include the current piece's position and rotation.

## Overview

After fixing the state exploration issue in the heuristic agent, we ran a comprehensive test with 5 episodes to evaluate its performance. The results demonstrate that the agent is now capable of playing Tetris effectively, using a variety of actions to optimize its board state.

## Episode Results

| Episode | Score | Lines Cleared | Steps | Duration (s) |
|---------|-------|---------------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | 9,100 | 76 | 912 | 40.57 |
| 2 | 26,300 | 219 | 2,475 | 113.37 |
| 3 | 9,100 | 76 | 913 | 41.45 |
| 4 | 12,200 | 99 | 1,185 | 55.48 |
| 5 | 5,200 | 45 | 553 | 25.33 |

## Heuristic Weights Used

| Weight | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| holes | -4.0 | Penalize creating holes |
| height | -0.5 | Penalize increasing height |
| bumpiness | -1.0 | Penalize uneven surfaces |
| lines_cleared | 3.0 | Reward clearing lines |
| well_depth | 0.5 | Reward creating wells for I-pieces |

These weights were determined through experimentation, testing various combinations to find a balance that produces good results. The values represent a trade-off between different objectives:

- A strong penalty for holes (-4.0) reflects the importance of avoiding trapped empty cells
- A moderate penalty for bumpiness (-1.0) encourages flat surfaces
- A lighter penalty for height (-0.5) allows for some vertical building when necessary
- A strong reward for lines cleared (3.0) prioritizes the main objective of the game
- A small reward for well depth (0.5) encourages creating opportunities for Tetris clears

## Analysis

1. **Action Diversity**: The agent now uses a diverse set of actions, with RIGHT (37.6%) and HARD_DROP (23.8%) being the most common. This indicates that the agent is actively exploring different positions before making its final decision.

2. **Performance Variability**: There is significant variability in performance across episodes, with scores ranging from 5,200 to 26,300. This is expected in Tetris due to the randomness of piece generation.

3. **Effective Line Clearing**: The agent successfully cleared an average of 103 lines per episode, with a maximum of 219 lines in episode 2. This demonstrates that the agent is effectively managing the board and creating opportunities for line clears.

4. **Efficient Decision Making**: Despite exploring many possible positions, the agent maintains reasonable decision times, with an average episode duration of 55.24 seconds.

5. **Simulation Effectiveness**: The simulation-based approach allows the agent to consider complex action sequences and their outcomes, resulting in more strategic play than would be possible with simple one-step lookahead.

## Conclusion

The fixed heuristic agent is now functioning as intended, exploring different piece positions and making informed decisions based on the heuristic evaluation. The performance metrics indicate that the agent is capable of playing Tetris at a reasonable level, with the ability to clear multiple lines and achieve high scores.

The key fix was modifying the `_hash_board_state` method to include the current piece's position and rotation in the hash, ensuring that the agent could properly explore different positions during its decision-making process.

The evolution from simple heuristics to a simulation-based approach with multiple weighted factors demonstrates the complexity of creating an effective Tetris agent. Each addition to our approach contributed to the agent's ability to make better decisions and achieve higher scores.

## Future Work

1. **Heuristic Tuning**: The current weights were chosen based on limited testing. A more systematic approach to weight tuning, such as genetic algorithms or grid search, could lead to better performance.

2. **Advanced Techniques**: The agent could be enhanced to recognize and execute advanced Tetris techniques, such as T-spins and perfect clears.

3. **Lookahead**: Implementing lookahead to consider the next piece in addition to the current piece could improve decision-making.

4. **Performance Optimization**: The current implementation explores a large number of states, which can be computationally expensive. Optimizing the exploration strategy could improve performance.

5. **Learning-Based Approach**: While our heuristic-based approach works well, a learning-based approach (such as reinforcement learning) could potentially achieve even better results by discovering optimal strategies without explicit programming.
